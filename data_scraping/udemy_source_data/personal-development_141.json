remembered for something.  A special accomplishment, a unique contribution to society, an extraordinary talent, a memorable life, or an everlasting love.  Nobody wants to just live and then be forgotten.  No one wants to atrophy into oblivion. Yet that is exactly what happens to most people. They dream about what life has to offer before they settle for what life ends up giving them.  It all seems very trite and cynical.  And very mundane! Your life not to meant to impress anyone. It is not an attempt to create significance.  But it does matter to those you love. Everything you do in life, every action you take or any path you follow, can only have one of two possible outcomes: •\tA Desired Outcome, or •\tA Consequential Outcome. Here is a simple illustration.   If you rob a bank, your Desired Outcome may be to get rich quick.  If the robbery is successful, you will be able to live the lifestyle of your dreams. You will gain financial freedom. The Desired Outcome of robbing a bank is to achieve all that! But if you get caught in the act, you will be thrown in jail and you will languish in a prison cell for many years.  In this scenario, the Consequential Outcome of robbing a bank is to lose your freedom.   The choice between these two outcomes is simple.  If you do not rob a bank, your life will not change.  Your financial situation will stay the same.  But you will not risk your personal freedom.  Yet, you have chosen to forego an opportunity.  The opportunity to achieve financial freedom.   And the cost of not robbing a bank is your opportunity cost!   Every time we make a decision, we choose between a consequential outcome and a desired outcome.  Sometimes we achieve the outcome we want. When that happens, we feel rewarded for our efforts.  We may choose a healthier lifestyle. Or book a dream vacation. Perhaps, we start a new career or celebrate a promotion. Potentially, we reach the next rung on the corporate ladder.  We may find a new partner in life or receive a spiritual blessing. But most of the time, our outcomes are unplanned and random. They become the unintended consequences of our actions. We cannot control these outcomes.  We therefore do not take responsibility for them.  And we usually do not credit these outcomes for our successes! They are simply a result of something. Consequential outcomes carry little tangible value. Yet, they can be enormously impactful.  A pregnancy can be classified as a Consequential Outcome. Accidents are the consequential outcome of an unplanned circumstance, yet they can be catastrophic. A scheduling error can delay an important meeting. A chance encounter can lead to a lifelong relationship. We cannot control these consequential outcomes, but we can attach their significance to an outcome we ultimately desire.  In other words, we can “manipulate” a random result to achieve a specific purpose. And that process of “outcome manipulation” is the essence of this course.  Just as an achievement is never the result of some random and unrelated sequence of events, a Desired Outcome can be aligned with any purpose.  This course will show you step-by-step how to create the Desired Outcome to any endeavor you undertake!"],"is_recently_published":false,"last_update_date":"2021-06-05","preview_url":"/course/3811846/preview/","learn_url":"/course/life-coaching-from-perception-to-reality/learn/","is_in_personal_plan_collection":false,"is_in_premium":false,"has_508_closed_captions":false,"is_coding_exercises_badge_eligible":false,"predictive_score":null,"relevancy_score":null,"input_features":null,"lecture_search_result":null,"curriculum_lectures":[],"order_in_results":null,"curriculum_items":[],"instructor_name":null,"content_info":"4
