In addition, some times people are reliable and great employees, but do not apply to jobs that are befitting to their personality.  For example, if you are shy, then applying for a job having to answer the phone and talk with people in a sales position may not be the best fit for you, but people do it every day and I have seen it so many times.  These methods in this Course will enable you to accurate match the best employee to the right positions, which will streamline your organization for greater success. Level I teaches the fundamentals of handwriting analysis for hiring employees, which is the foundation for the more in-depth concepts discussed in Level II and Level III.

This is not just a Course on handwriting analysis, but also about outward human behavior and how it correlates to handwriting and the life we lead with the people we choose to spend time with.  Each Level in this Course builds on each other to provide you with a full perspective analysis of this dynamic phenomena.","Level II of this Course will teach you complex characteristics in the handwriting on a level that reveals deep rooted secrets, desires, fantasies, and fears of the person's handwriting you are analyzing.  Handwriting analysis is so powerful that people who choose to disguise their handwriting to avoid revealing deep-rooted secrets actually reveal more about themselves because the specific handwriting strokes they choose to make to disguise their handwriting are traits that they add that would not easily be detected normally, but actually help in finding out more about them.  Imagine being able to look at a person's handwriting and be able to see their secrets, inner desires, fantasies, and fears, which may not be shared with anybody else.  These techniques are proven successful whether used for business, for fun by analyzing friends' handwriting samples, or an additional skill you'd like to add to your already existing repertoire of methods employed.  You will be fascinated will the skills you acquire from taking Level II and this Course.  It is recommended that you take Level I first prior to taking Level II as Level I serves as the foundation for the complex techniques discussed in Level II."],"is_recently_published":false,"last_update_date":"2017-12-05","preview_url":"/course/60724/preview/","learn_url":"/course/measurement-based-handwriting-movement-analysis-level-2/learn/","is_in_personal_plan_collection":false,"is_in_premium":false,"has_508_closed_captions":false,"is_coding_exercises_badge_eligible":false,"predictive_score":null,"relevancy_score":null,"input_features":null,"lecture_search_result":null,"curriculum_lectures":[],"order_in_results":null,"curriculum_items":[],"instructor_name":null,"content_info":"2.5
