Each lesson starts by explaining how the logic works in one of the digital circuits. In this course, the programming code for the circuit, in the fpga, will be described with Vhdl programming code. The programming code for each of the 15 circuits, are converted to a bit file and the bit file programs the circuit into an fpga trainer board. The trainer board is now ready to test the circuit. Step by step procedures will show you exactly how to do this course.        Learning how to program an FPGA is just like learning how to drive a car. You can read all about driving a car, but until you get behind the wheel and try it for yourself you won't be able to do it.
