for breathwork and comes from two terms in Sanskrit – \"Prana\", or life source and \"Ayama\", expansion. Therefore, the practice of Pranayama is the regulation of the life source within the body to reach a higher state of consciousness. Conscious control of the breath creates a wave-like motion that results in relaxation and energy to both the body and mind. Controlling Prana is the way to control of the mind; Prana and the mind are intimately intertwined. When we come to higher states of concentration, the breath slows down. The breath is the most condensed and gross manifestation of Prana. Thoughts are the most subtle or fine manifestation of Prana. If Prana is strong, we can take on difficult obstacles; if Prana is weak, we cannot do very simple tasks. If we can slow the breath, concentration will increase. Negative emotions have a direct influence on the breath. With negative thoughts, the breath becomes irregular and unsteady. Therefore, using the breathing exercises of Pranayama, we can control our thoughts and keep the mind in a positive state. Through regular practice of Asana and Pranayama, the mind will progress in meditation and have higher levels of concentration.","This is a certified course.
