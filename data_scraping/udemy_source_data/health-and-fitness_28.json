and medicine be thy food.\" - Hippocrates     Most of today's chronic diseases are attributed to the Standard American Diet (SAD). Accelerated aging is also a repercussion of the typical American diet. In week 1, creating a food journal for the first seven days of the course will give you a good idea why you might be overweight, are type II diabetic, or have hypertension. The issues with your diet can't be changed until you become aware of what foods are deteriorating your health. Food journals offer a tremendous amount of information concerning your health. Once you're conscious of what you're putting into your body, you'll quickly understand why health issues are becoming a concern in your life.","Every cell in your body hears your every thought. We become what we think. The second week delves into how beliefs are formed. Only you can change your thoughts. But you have to unravel the \"garbage\" in your subconscious mind, erase the negative recorded voice you hear, and rewrite your beliefs that will serve your health and every other aspect of your life. There will be a recorded hypnotherapist session introducing you into how a negative body image will make you believe that it's okay to be overweight so that you continue habits to stay in your current unhealthy comfort zone. Changing your negative beliefs that don't serve you for positive beliefs to help transform your life is the only way to make sustainable changes.","Stress kills! It slowly breaks down your body bit-by-bit each day until one day you realize you have serious health issues that are going to take time and effort to reverse. Almost 300 years ago, Benjamin Franklin coined the phrase, \"An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.\" And those words ring even louder today. We live in an over-stressed society that robs our bodies of nutrients and cripples our immune systems. The third week will enlighten you on the quiet destruction stress has on our bodies when we enter the fight-or flight response. You'll be armed with a beginner's course to gentle yoga that will teach you to use your breath and body to get out of the stress response and into the relaxation (health) response."],"is_recently_published":false,"last_update_date":"2016-12-27","preview_url":"/course/752834/preview/","learn_url":"/course/4-week-functional-health-tansformation-christopher-sasha/learn/","is_in_personal_plan_collection":false,"is_in_premium":false,"has_508_closed_captions":false,"is_coding_exercises_badge_eligible":false,"predictive_score":null,"relevancy_score":null,"input_features":null,"lecture_search_result":null,"curriculum_lectures":[],"order_in_results":null,"curriculum_items":[],"instructor_name":null,"content_info":"3
