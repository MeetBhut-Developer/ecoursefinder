It promotes faster progression towards your movement goals, decreases fear, mitigates your risk of injury, lightens the vibe during training, and ensures better results for coaches and businesses involved in sport or movement arts.  You will learn a unifying theory of falling continuums and how to engrain them in your natural reactions in order to respond better in many falling scenarios. Learn techniques like side rolls, break falls, half rolls, landing correctly, assisted dive rolls, and much more.
