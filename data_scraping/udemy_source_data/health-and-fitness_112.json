The Fundamental Mat movements/exercises are described in the NWCC Pilates® Workbook Foundation, which offers a basic understanding of the NWCC Pilates® Fundamental Transitional Exercise System. This system is a modern day version of the Pilates Method known as Bodiesology®.","Those students and teachers who have trained in the Pilates Method are aware of its founder, Joseph Pilates; however, this Introductory Mat Course describes his role in bringing together this world renown system of physical education, also known as “Contrology.”  As well, this Introductory Mat Course describes the principles and concepts, which Pilates himself founded almost a hundred years ago.  We are privileged to teach this online Introductory Mat Course, as a way of honoring the teachings of Joseph Pilates, and at the same time, bringing forward a new way of thinking, in terms of the physical conditioning of the body. The mind and body approach to fitness has reached a turning point with the knowledge brought forward in modern science. We are offering an expanded view of this mind and body approach to encompass the understanding of the energetic body, which plays a role in the awareness and movement of the body."],"is_recently_published":false,"last_update_date":"2017-09-01","preview_url":"/course/1090448/preview/","learn_url":"/course/nwcc-pilates-fundamental-mat-introductory-course/learn/","is_in_personal_plan_collection":false,"is_in_premium":false,"has_508_closed_captions":false,"is_coding_exercises_badge_eligible":false,"predictive_score":null,"relevancy_score":null,"input_features":null,"lecture_search_result":null,"curriculum_lectures":[],"order_in_results":null,"curriculum_items":[],"instructor_name":null,"content_info":"1
