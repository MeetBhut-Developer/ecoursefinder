will experience how pay their expenses/bills through Financial Innovation meaning actually seeing what expenses are being paid versus just paying them.

This experience can be for whatever goals you want to meet.(Example: A student may want to purchase a home or plan a vacation or just simple get take control of pay your bills). I want my students to leave with the knowledge of understanding the importance of not only paying their expenses/bills but also understanding what's coming in and going out. I also want my students to understand by making payments on time can save the cost of late fees and how it can add up over time. My students will also experience the connection between simply paying your credits cards by the due date will automatically help their credit score go up.
