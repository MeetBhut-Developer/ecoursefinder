We aim to show you how to start, how to progress and how to make what you do work for you. However, you won’t be taking this journey alone. Keeping you company will be two actors, Lyndsay and Brad. They’ll be learning just like you. Sometimes, especially in the later stages of this journey, they won’t even realize that they are learning. That’s the thing about acting. Life and what it does to you as you go along, as you navigate through your experiences and emotions, is often the best training ground that you as an actor can have. For the actor, nothing in life is ever wasted. In this course we will look at monologues and scene work and the supplementary material includes improvisation exercises for you to practice. But it differs from other similar courses in that we will not simply be covering the purely technical aspects of acting. Through Lyndsay and Brad you will be given an insight into what the life of an actor entails, - the hopes and fears that every actor experiences in their struggle to succeed. It is about the technique of acting but it is also about what it means to be an actor in a more general sense. This is why we look at such issues as confidence and the audition process. Our intention is to provide you with a glimpse, sometimes funny, sometimes sad, always relevant, of the life of the actor as a whole. Our greatest wish is that you find it entertaining, interesting but, more importantly, useful in your endeavour to make this industry your career."],"is_recently_published":false,"last_update_date":"2020-12-06","preview_url":"/course/3675946/preview/","learn_url":"/course/the-drama-sessions/learn/","is_in_personal_plan_collection":false,"is_in_premium":false,"has_508_closed_captions":false,"is_coding_exercises_badge_eligible":false,"predictive_score":null,"relevancy_score":null,"input_features":null,"lecture_search_result":null,"curriculum_lectures":[],"order_in_results":null,"curriculum_items":[],"instructor_name":null,"content_info":"3
