transformation.  In fact, it’s more than a course, it’s a guided journey of self-evaluation, reflection and strategic planning to propel your finance organization forward.  Not only are organizations under fire to keep up with internal and external forces that require adaptation and change, so to are the finance functions that support the organization.    The modern finance function has never had as great an opportunity as it has today to play a strategic advisory role inside any organization.  Yet, most finance leaders and those working in the finance organization find themselves still buried in transactional processing.  This course shares with you a path forward by first understanding where you as a finance leader or aspiring finance leader, and your finance organization stand today.  From there, you will learn for yourself the end goal, whether its to be a partner in business or a trusted advisor internally and externally on behalf of management.
