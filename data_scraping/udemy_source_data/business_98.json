seasoned professional sales person will be able to refine their skills, create useful habits, improve their style, maximize efforts, remove doubts on contrary sales methods and add confidence to their abilities. We use the natural habits of human nature and the underlying psychology to find a prospect, understand the motivation and create a sale. For those in the beginning of their career, a comprehensive understanding of the entire sales process will guide them to a more confident approach to each prospect, and hence derive a far better closing ratio.","Selling is a natural act common to all human affairs. Everyone is involved in trying to persuade another person to either do or not do something on a daily basis. Most of the time it&#39;s just a simple request, but occasionally the task becomes more complex. Understanding human motivation and the corresponding methodologies that aid in the fulfillment of that desire is at the heart of selling. Having a simple, yet organized template for uncovering anyone&#39;s motive for almost any purpose is demonstrated in this course. ","The objective here is to teach you lifelong skills that will help increase your ability to close any type of sale, improve your chances of succeeding in an ever increasing competitive marketplace, and help you gain confidence in your personal life by identifying, understanding, and interacting with the four major personality types. Once you learn the skills, improving your ability to close a sale will only increase your income and create lifelong prosperity."],"is_recently_published":false,"last_update_date":"2018-07-20","preview_url":"/course/81464/preview/","learn_url":"/course/master-sales-training/learn/","is_in_personal_plan_collection":false,"is_in_premium":false,"has_508_closed_captions":false,"is_coding_exercises_badge_eligible":false,"predictive_score":null,"relevancy_score":null,"input_features":null,"lecture_search_result":null,"curriculum_lectures":[],"order_in_results":null,"curriculum_items":[],"instructor_name":null,"content_info":"4.5
