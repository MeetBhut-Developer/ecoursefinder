You will be able to plan your writing time in a realistic, rewarding way. You will develop good habits that can precede your writing session. You will take away guidelines in choosing your subject matter and insights into how one successful work can lead to the next one. Discover the appropriate narrative voice for each of your projects, as a good portion of your animated workshop of several hours and 12 lectures and examples and readings is devoted to exactly that: finding your narrative voice. You will discover what KIND of a writer you wish to be: what literary terrain you wish to occupy. Develop your brand—here! Practice the tried and proven literary devices that master writers have used, such as Time Sequence, Action, Image, Dialogue, Character. If you ever experience writer’s block, you learn a proven method of breaking through. You will know exercises that hone your skills and that you can practice at any time. Your manuscript lacks that 10-20% of refinements that will make it publishable? Here you will learn about the revision process: what material to cut and enrich that enables you to reach that 100% plateau. You will have a step-by-step guide to publishing your work: E edition and trade paperback. Information about the commercial publishing world and what goes into a successful query letter to editors, literary agents and publishers. “From decades of experience in the publishing and writing world, I have come to know how scary writing can be and so I designed this workshop for writers of all levels that supports you, soothes any fears you might have, provides the nuts and bolts of the Publishing and Writing and Writers’ World, and finally--for me most important--to contribute in real ways to a happy, successful writing life.” Anthony
