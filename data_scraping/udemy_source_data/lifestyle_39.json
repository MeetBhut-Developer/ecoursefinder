Course Is For You If:  You've always wanted to learn to draw portraits  You don't have a ton of free time but want to learn a new skill  You've taken a break from art and need some motivation to start again  You want an easier start to drawing than pulling out paper or a canvas  Just looking to see if you have a hidden talent  :p    What Is Included In This Course:  You will learn techniques I use on how to make portraits of a subject of your choosing. Each lecture breaks down the process into easy steps so you can take an organized approach to finishing your masterpiece. Starting with the shape of the head, then facial features, hair and headwear, drawing their name, coloring your subject, and finally, handling revisions if you happen to be doing a commission for a customer.  If you prefer to learn offline to avoid distractions, I have given all my students the option to download my lecture videos. I will also show examples of other pieces I have completed using these techniques to give you an idea of what creations are possible, even with a basic program like Microsoft Paint. Although I prefer making portraits with a drawing tablet, it is not necessary at all. Each brushstroke can be done with your computer mouse as well.  It's super fun drawing portraits of people and characters I idolize but I also enjoy seeing how satisfied my clients are from drawings I've made of their faces. Making digital art is honestly something I am still a bit new to, but since I have been seeing lots of great results and positive feedback from it, I thought I'd show you guys just how easy it is to get started with making portraits like these.   Whether you want to make art just for the love of it, or one day have it paying all your bills, I think this course can help any beginner or intermediate artist improve their skills and confidence to pursue their passion. Art has been a passion of mine since I've been a toddler and if you haven't begun your artist journey or have taken a break from it, this is your chance to start or start anew.   I'm ready when you are.
