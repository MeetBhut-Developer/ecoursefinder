 course is designed for all aspiring parents who want a child of their dream.","In the first section of this course complete information about neurological function of our body is explained. This is important because it is the mind which differentiates us from other living beings. Here neurological term is not used as physiological but about all mental, emotional, spiritual functions these nerves conduct and how our conscious & subconscious mind gets coded with each emotions. It gives information about centres of subtle energy or chakras which govern physiological as well as psychological functions, when these chakras develop in foetus and how can mother influence its development. Student learns about Panchkosha, the five subtle energy sheaths, how soul is covered with these sheaths, when do they develop in foetus and how can mother's efforts influence its development. Student also learns about five elements - Panchmahabhut, of which our physical and emotional body is made of, its relationship with tridosha and how the prakruti of a mother and father influence conception and how can you avoid chances of development of prakruti related diseases in child. This section helps aspiring parents to plan for their programmed dream child from 3 months prior to conception by informing them how to make their body satvic to get divine child.","The second section teaches the student about how to use all the interventions in programming the foetus thus convincing the student that whatever means she will use to design her child in womb has a evidenced base scientific proof and is just not a superstition.
